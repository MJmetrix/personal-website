                    I am a Computer Science student at Ateneo de Manila University, 
                    aiming to explore careers that benefit peopleâ€™s daily lives through 
                    building software. I am taking specialized studies in enterprise systems 
                    and financial management with the goal of building tools that automate the 
                    technical processes of industries.

                    As a student, I have strong leadership and management skills in tech projects, 
                    with strengths in communication, administrative duties, and technical expertise. 
                    Currently, I am undergoing an internship at AHEAD Educational Group as an IT & Web 
                    Maintenance Intern, further honing my technical skills in web development, using HTML, 
                    CSS, and Python Django.

                    Outside of school, I enjoy outdoor activities, such as swimming and taking leisurely walks 
                    with my pets. I also like reading light novels, manga, manhwa, and any other form of literature 
                    during my free time.
